#BossaBot Tracker
#BossaBot is something that was just recently caught out in the wild. It's a binary Linux IRC backdoor.
#I'm choosing to take this seriously, because the first posting I found regarding this bot was on 8/26. I saw 9 hits against our IP space on 8/27 from a single IP address, with more hits since then. This is less than a week's time.

#This is a list of bots I've seen from 8/26 onward attacking my IP space.
