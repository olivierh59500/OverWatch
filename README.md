OverWatch
=========

OverWatch is just a term for malware/malicious traffic or other unusual observations made by members of WeAreTheArtillery. Nope, that's all there is to it. 

You'll get IP addresses, domain names, WHOIS data, payloads, characteristics and/or other notes as applicable. Check back often!
