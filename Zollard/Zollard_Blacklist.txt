#Zollard Botnet
#This is a list of hosts that appear to be members of the Zollard Botnet.
#Zollard targets internet-enabled, embedded devices; for example, SOHO routers among other devices.
#All Zollard hosts have web servers listening on 58455/tcp; in order to expand the botnet, one of the attack techniques used is CVE-2012-1823 (Reference: http://eindbazen.net/2012/05/php-cgi-advisory-cve-2012-1823/). If successful, the exploit calls back to the attacking server on 58455/tcp to download a payload for the appropriate CPU architecture for the embedded device:
#/x86
#/arm
#/ppc
#/mips
#/mipsel
#/arm
#/armeabi
#/nodes
#/sig
#This is a list of IP addresses I have observed serving this malware.
#Remediation: Block outbound TCP connections to 58455/tcp, blacklist connections to these hosts
